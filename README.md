# software-testing

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

    To ensure functionality, I write comprehensive test cases covering various scenarios. For security, I follow best practices, such as input validation, encryption, and secure coding guidelines.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
    I engage with users through interviews, surveys, and feedback. I try to understand their points, preferences, and goals and translate these insights into software requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
  
    Define the problem, user requirements, and constraints.
    Divide it into modules or components.
    Continuously improve the design based on feedback and changing needs.
